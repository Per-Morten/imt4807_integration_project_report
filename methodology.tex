\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Communication}
Communication with Vixel was done through biweekly status meetings, where they would be briefed on progress, and answer any questions we had related to the direction of the project. Additionally, we would sit in their office when working on the project, allowing for easy communication. Any communication outside of these situations happened through Slack\footnote{\url{https://slack.com/}}.

\subsection{Pair Programming}
Throughout the project, we adopted a pair programming methodology. This was done to ensure that both group members were familiar with the functionality of the code, and to allow us to quickly exchange ideas as to how the functionality could be implemented.
