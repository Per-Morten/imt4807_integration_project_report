\section{Result}
The final prototype consists of a few different functionalities. For the host side, we have a Unity application which is able to stream to either YouTube or Twitch.tv from a camera that is in the scene. The scene itself consists of a timer on the user interface for latency comparisons as well as a few interactible cubes. 
The client side consists of a simple web page with a invisible Unity WebGL application. This application receives the livestream URL from the host and adds an embedded livestream player to the web page. Once the livestream is active, the client can then interact with the host by clicking on the cubes which changes their colour.
